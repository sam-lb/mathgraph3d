Before you contribute, be sure to familiarize yourself with the code (or at least the relevant parts of it). In the README it says that the grapher relies on the pygame library. However, most of that has been abstracted away so you don't really need to know pygame to contribute. It's also worth the time to read through the algorithms for this code [here](http://sambrunacini.com/algorithms.html) (it's the first one on the page).

# Anyone who knows python is welcome to contribute. If you do, make sure to follow these guidelines:
- Use PEP 8 naming conventions. `ALL_CAPS_SEPARATED_BY_UNDERSCORES` for constants, `CamelCase` for classes, `snake_case` for functions and variable names.
- Also try to make variable names descriptive. No one letter names unless it is an iteration variable or has obvious meaning (i.e. x, y, or z).
- Document! Write at least a simple docstring for each function, method, and class. If something you write uses a complicated algorithm or piece of math, please explain it! If it's necessary, I'll include it in my algorithm explanations page for this project (link above).
- 4 space indents.
- You don't really have to conform to any line length restrictions, but be reasonable about it. Always prefer shorter, clearer code over a big one line mess.

# If you have questions, ask them.
Raise an issue on the repo for any questions you have about contributing or about the grapher itself. Keep in mind that the goal of this project is to help people visualize mathematics! If you think a feature should be added, open an issue and write about it. Chances are, it will get added in soon enough. 

If you don't want to raise an issue you can contact me at pythongrapheremail@gmail.com. I will not open any emails with attachments.
