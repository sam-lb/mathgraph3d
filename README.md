# python-grapher

python-grapher is 3D plotting software. The graphics are made with [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) and the GUI is made with [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). It also relies on [this project](https://github.com/sam-lb/CAS) for evaluating user input.

It can plot 2D functions, 3D functions, 3D parametric lines, 3D parametric surfaces, revolution surfaces, functions of cylindrical coordinates, functions of spherical coordinates, and vector fields. It can also load and plot data from .csv files.

There is lots of information (and a beta download) about this project on my website: http://sambrunacini.com/
