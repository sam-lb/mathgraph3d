# MathGraph3D

MathGraph3D is 3D plotting software. The graphics are made with [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) and the GUI is made with [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). It also relies on [this project](https://github.com/sam-lb/CAS) for evaluating user input.

It can plot 2D functions, 3D functions, 3D parametric lines, 3D parametric surfaces, revolution surfaces, functions of cylindrical coordinates, functions of spherical coordinates, vector fields, slope fields, implicit 2D functions, polar functions, recurrence relations, complex-valued functions. It can also load and plot data from .csv files, plot planes given 3 points, and show points in space.

There is lots of information (and a download link) about this project on my website: http://sambrunacini.com/
It's also available for download [on itch.io](https://sam-brunacini.itch.io/mathgraph3d).
The web version is also available [on my website](http://plotter.sambrunacini.com/).
